Python is interperator languagee
 - it executes line by line

 steps
    -> syntax check
    -> compile the code
    -> linker
    -> machine language
    -> execution

    py -> pyc - binary code

 Data types:
  - int             a = 5   - immutable
  - string         a = "Abhi"         - immutable
  - list          a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
  - tuple          a = (1, 2, 3)          - immutable - constant list
  - dictionary     a = { 'a':1, 'b':2}      key can be string, int, tuples - only immutable

  immutable, but memory block is created new when you try to add again value. so kind of mutable but not.

  - string slicing
