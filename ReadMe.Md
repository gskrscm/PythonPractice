Python is interperator languagee
 - it executes line by line

 steps
    -> syntax check
    -> compile the code
    -> linker
    -> machine language
    -> execution

    py -> pyc - binary code

 Data types:
  - int             a = 5                    - immutable
  - string         a = "Abhi"                - immutable
  - list          a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
  - tuple          a = (1, 2, 3)             - immutable - constant list
  - dictionary     a = { 'a':1, 'b':2}      key is immutable can be string, int, tuples - only immutables

  About immutables, when you assign second time value, the second value is printed because the firs value is totally
  destructed and new value created.
  -  new memory block is created new when you try to add again value. so kind of mutable but not.

  - string slicing



  Things to go thru

  - Regular expression modules
  - database modules for mysql
  - threading
  - json and xml data parsing
  - rest api - httplib, httplib2 - get, post, delete, put
  - Basic file handeling
